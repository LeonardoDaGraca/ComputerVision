# Project 5
This is the readme for project 5. The goal for the project is learning how to build, train, analyze, and modify a deep network for a recognition task. We will be using the MNIST digit recognition data set, primarily because it is simple enough to build and train a network without a GPU, but also because it is challenging enough to provide a good example of what deep networks can do.

## Project Details
For this assignment there are 7 programs:
- The prep_net.py program completes parts A-D from Task 1 of this project. The program does not take any command line arguments.
- The run_net.py program completes parts E from Task 1 of this project. The program does not take any command line arguments.
- The input_net.py program completes parts F from Task 1 of this project. The program's usage is: usage: input_net.py [image directory].
- The examine_net.py program completes Task 2 of this project. The program does not take any command line arguments.
- The greek_net.py program completes Task 3 of this project. The program does not take any command line arguments.
- The net_experiment.py program completes Task 4 of this project. The program does not take any command line arguments.
- The extension.py program is my extension for this project. The program does not take any command line arguments.

## Notes
Extensions:
1. My extension is in my extension.py file. I trained more Greek letters other than alpha, beta, and gamma. I chose to train the network on the Greek letters delta, epsilon, theta, sigma, and mu.
